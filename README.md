# ðŸ§  AI Playground

Welcome to collection of experimental and educational projects in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

This repository is a sandbox for exploring different neural network architectures, algorithms, and techniques. Each project is self-contained and organized in the `projects/` directory.

## ðŸ—‚ Structure

Each project lives in its own subdirectory inside `projects/`, and typically contains:
- A Python script and/or Jupyter Notebook
- A `README.md` explaining the purpose of the project
- (Optional) Supporting files like datasets or model checkpoints
