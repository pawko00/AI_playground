# ðŸ§  AI Playground

Welcome to the **AI Playground** â€” a collection of experimental, educational, and past machine learning projects.

This repository serves as both:
- A **sandbox** for testing and exploring various AI/ML ideas,
- A **central archive** for my previously completed projects, which I decided to properly organize and host on GitHub.

Many of these projects were developed as part of my learning journey, and this repo is meant to document that progress while keeping everything accessible in one place.

## ðŸ—‚ Structure

Each project lives in its own subdirectory inside `projects/`, and typically contains:
- A Python script and/or Jupyter Notebook
- A `README.md` explaining the purpose of the project
- (Optional) Supporting files like datasets or model checkpoints
